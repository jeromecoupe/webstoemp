I worked with the team at Louïz to redesign and develop their new website. The brief was to create a clean layout and an easy to use yet powerful publishing platform that would reflect the cosy atmosphere of that small but mighty radio station. Content created by pros and students alike can either be broadcasted via FM or published as podcasts.

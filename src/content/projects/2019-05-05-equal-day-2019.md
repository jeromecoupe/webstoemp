EQUAL asked me to develop the website for the 2019 edition of EQUAL Day: "Civil disobedience and|or the rule of law". The website would only exist for a year, should be easily archivable as static files and was going to change a lot before the event. We decided to build a multilingual site with Eleventy (11ty).

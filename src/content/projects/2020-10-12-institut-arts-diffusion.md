The Institut des Arts de Diffusion hired me to redesign and build their public website. We started with a logo refresh and a simple but effective graphical chart. We then devised a flexible information architecture based on modular landing pages and well defined content types. An easy to use control panel allows non technical team members to manage all aspects of the site.

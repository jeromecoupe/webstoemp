# Webstoemp

Webstoemp is the online space of Jérôme Coupé, web designer, front-end developer and teacher from Brussels, Belgium.

**tl;dr**: Personal websites are not themes. Don't be the next [Paul Fleury](https://pflry.eu/).

This is my personal website, not a starter kit or template to clone or copy. Plenty of those are available should you need one. This code is in a public repository and you are welcome to peek under the hood to see "how the ~~sausage~~ stoemp is made". Please do not copy or reuse the design, code and/or content. Thank you.
